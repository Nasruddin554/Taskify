## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd taskify
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
   
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your Supabase credentials:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Development Approach

### Architecture

Taskify follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Pages**: High-level components representing routes in the application
2. **Components**: Reusable UI elements organized by feature
3. **Contexts**: Global state management for auth, tasks, and other shared data
4. **Hooks**: Custom logic extracted for reusability across components

### State Management Strategy

- **User Authentication**: Managed through AuthContext using Supabase auth
- **Task Data**: TaskContext provides CRUD operations and filtering capabilities
- **UI State**: Local component state for UI-specific concerns
- **API Data**: TanStack Query for data fetching, caching, and synchronization

### Responsive Design

The application implements a mobile-first approach using:

- Tailwind CSS for responsive layouts
- Adaptive components that adjust to different screen sizes
- Strategic use of flex and grid layouts
- Optimized touch interactions for mobile users

## Assumptions & Trade-offs

### Assumptions

1. **User Roles**: The application assumes three user roles (admin, manager, user) with varying permissions
2. **Internet Connectivity**: Users are expected to have consistent internet access
3. **Modern Browsers**: The application targets modern browsers with good ES6+ support

### Trade-offs

1. **Client-side Rendering**: Chose CSR for simplicity, sacrificing some SEO benefits that SSR would provide
2. **Context API vs. Redux**: Used Context API for simplicity and sufficient performance at current scale
3. **Local Storage Persistence**: For demo purposes, some data persists in localStorage rather than always hitting the database
4. **Simplified Error Handling**: Focused on happy path scenarios with basic error states rather than comprehensive error handling

## Future Improvements

- **Offline Support**: Implement service workers for offline functionality
- **Performance Optimization**: Add virtualization for large task lists
- **Advanced Filtering**: Develop more sophisticated task filtering and search capabilities
- **Accessibility**: Comprehensive WCAG compliance audit and improvements
- **Analytics**: Add usage analytics to track feature engagement
